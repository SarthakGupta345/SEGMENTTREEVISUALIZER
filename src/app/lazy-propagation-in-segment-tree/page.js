                    <p className="st-text">
                        Lazy Propagation is an optimization technique used in Segment Trees to
                        efficiently handle <strong>range update operations</strong>. Instead
                        of updating all elements in a range immediately, updates are delayed
                        and applied only when required.

                    {/* WHEN IT IS USED */}

                    <p className="st-text">
                        Lazy Propagation is mainly used when we need to perform{" "}
                        <strong>range-based updates</strong>. For example:
                    </p>

                    <ul className="st-list">
                        <li>Adding a value to all elements in a range <code className="st-inline-code">[ql, qr]</code></li>
                        <li>Assigning a value to all elements in a range</li>
                        <li>Updating ranges multiple times before querying</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p className="st-highlight">
                        Without lazy propagation, these operations would require updating
                        every element in the range, leading to poor performance.

                    <p className="st-text">
                        As the name suggests, lazy propagation works by{" "}
                        <strong>postponing updates</strong>. When a range update is applied,
                        the Segment Tree node stores the update value in a separate{" "}
                        <code className="st-inline-code">lazy</code> array instead of
                        immediately updating its children.
                    </p>

                    <p className="st-text">
                        For example, if we need to add <code className="st-inline-code">7</code>{" "}
                        to the range <code className="st-inline-code">[5, 8]</code>, the node

                        <p className="st-text">
                            The actual update is applied only when this segment is required

                        </p>

                    <p className="st-text">

                    <h1 className="st-title">Structure of Lazy Propagation</h1>

                    <p className="st-text">
                        Lazy Propagation is an extension of the Segment Tree that is used when
                        <strong> range-based update operations</strong> are required. The core
                        structure of the Segment Tree remains the same; lazy propagation only
                        changes how and when updates are applied.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="st-heading">Lazy Array</h2>
                    <p className="st-text">
                        Along with the segment tree array, an additional array called the
                        <code className="st-inline-code">lazy</code> array is maintained. This
                        array stores pending updates for segments that have not yet been
                        propagated to their child nodes.
                    </p>

                    <p className="st-text">
                        When a range update completely covers a segment, the update is applied
                        to the current node, and the update value is stored in the
                        <code className="st-inline-code">lazy</code> array. The children are not
                        updated immediately.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="st-heading">Deferred Updates</h2>
                    <p className="st-text">
                        Updates are intentionally delayed. A segment is only updated when it
                        is required during a query or when further traversal of that segment
                        is necessary. This avoids repeated updates on large ranges.

                        <p className="st-text">
                            Lazy propagation postpones updates until they are actually needed,

                        In contrast, a Lazy Segment Tree may contain pending updates stored in the
                        <code className="st-inline-code">lazy</code> array. Therefore, before using the
                        value of any node, we must first check whether a lazy value exists. If a
                        pending update is found, it is propagated to the child nodes using the
                        <code className="st-inline-code">push</code> function, and the current node’s
                        value is updated accordingly.

                    <p className="st-text">
                        After ensuring that all pending updates are applied, the query proceeds using
                        the same overlap-based logic as a normal Segment Tree to compute the required
                        range sum.

                    <p className="st-text">
                        In a Lazy Segment Tree, a point update follows the same traversal path as in a
                        normal Segment Tree, but with additional handling for pending updates. Starting
                        from the root, the tree is traversed recursively toward the leaf node that
                        represents the target index.

                    <p className="st-text">
                        At each visited node, the algorithm first checks whether there is any pending
                        update stored in the <code className="st-inline-code">lazy</code> array. If a
                        lazy value exists, it is propagated downward using the
                        <code className="st-inline-code">push</code> function so that the current node
                        and its children reflect all deferred updates before continuing the traversal.

                    <p className="st-text">
                        Once the traversal reaches the leaf node corresponding to the update index,
                        the node’s value is updated directly. As the recursion unwinds, all ancestor
                        nodes are recomputed using the merge operation (such as summation), ensuring
                        that the changes are correctly reflected throughout the tree.

                        The range update function is the core component of a Lazy Segment Tree. Its
                        purpose is to apply an update operation (such as addition or assignment) to
                        all elements within a given range
                        <code className="st-inline-code">[ql, qr]</code> without explicitly updating
                        every element in that range.
                    </p>

                    <p className="st-text">
                        When the current segment
                        <code className="st-inline-code">[l, r]</code> is completely outside the
                        update range, the function returns immediately, as no update is required.
                        If the segment is fully covered by the update range, the update is applied
                        directly to the node’s stored value, and the update information is recorded
                        in the <code className="st-inline-code">lazy</code> array. This indicates that
                        the update should be propagated to the children at a later time.

                    <p className="st-text">
                        In the case of partial overlap, the algorithm first checks for any pending
                        lazy updates at the current node. If such updates exist, they are propagated
                        downward using the <code className="st-inline-code">push</code> function to
                        ensure correctness. The update operation is then recursively applied to both
                        child segments, and after the recursion completes, the current node’s value
                        is recomputed using the merge operation.

                            <code className="st-inline-code">O(log n)</code> time, even for large input

                            where the update range consists of a single index. In other words, when the
                            start and end of the update range are equal, both operations behave
                            identically.
