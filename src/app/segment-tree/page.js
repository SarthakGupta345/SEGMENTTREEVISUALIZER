          <h1 className="st-title">What is a Segment Tree?</h1>

          <p className="st-text">
            A Segment Tree is a tree-based data structure used to efficiently
            handle range-based queries on an array. It allows us to query
            information (such as sum, minimum, or maximum) over a subarray and
            also update elements efficiently.
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">In simple terms, a Segment Tree is used when:</p>

          <ul className="st-list">
            <li>You need to answer range queries frequently</li>
            <li>The array values can change over time</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="st-heading">Why do we need a Segment Tree?</h2>

          <p className="st-text">
            Consider an array:{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">
              arr = [a&#8321;, a&#8322;, a&#8323;, a&#8324;, …, a&#8345;]
            </code>
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">Suppose we have two types of queries:</p>

          <ul className="st-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Range Query:</strong> Find the sum of elements from index l
              to r
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Update Query:</strong> Update the value at a specific index
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="st-heading">Problem with Prefix Sum</h2>

          <p className="st-text">
            Using a prefix sum array, we can answer range sum queries in
            <code className="st-inline-code"> O(1)</code> time. However, when an update happens:
          </p>

          <ul className="st-list">
            <li>The array value changes</li>
            <li>The prefix sum array must be rebuilt</li>
            <li>
              This rebuild takes <code className="st-inline-code">O(n)</code> time
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="st-text">
            If there are many update queries, the total time complexity becomes
            <code className="st-inline-code">O(q · n)</code>, which is not feasible for large inputs (e.g.,
            n = 10⁶).
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            This leads to <strong>TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2 className="st-heading">How Segment Tree Solves This</h2>

          <p className="st-text">
            A Segment Tree solves this problem efficiently by:
          </p>

          <ul className="st-list">
            <li>
              Answering range queries in <code className="st-inline-code">O(log n)</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Handling updates in <code className="st-inline-code">O(log n)</code>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="st-text">So, even if we have many queries:</p>

          <ul className="st-list">
            <li>
              Total time complexity becomes <code className="st-inline-code">O(q log n)</code>
            </li>
            <li>This is efficient and feasible for large inputs</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="st-heading">Conclusion</h2>

          <ul className="st-list">
            <li>Prefix sums fail when frequent updates are involved</li>
            <li>Segment Trees handle both queries and updates efficiently</li>
            <li>
              It is a reliable and scalable solution for range-based problems
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="st-highlight">
            That is why Segment Trees are widely used in competitive programming
            and high-performance systems.
          </p>

          <h1 className="st-title">Structure of the Segment Tree</h1>

          <p className="st-text">
            We can take a <strong>divide-and-conquer</strong> approach when it
            comes to array segments. We compute and store the sum of the elements
            of the whole array, i.e., the sum of the segment
            <code className="st-inline-code"> a[0 … n - 1]</code>
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            We then split the array into two halves
            <code className="st-inline-code"> a[0 … (n - 1)/2]</code> and
            <code className="st-inline-code"> a[(n + 1)/2 … n - 1]</code> and
            compute the sum of each half and store them. Each of these two halves
            is again split into two smaller halves, and this process continues
            until all segments reach size 1.
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            These segments can be viewed as forming a binary tree. The root of
            this tree represents the segment <br />
            <code className="st-inline-code"> a[0 … n - 1]</code>, and each
            internal node has exactly two children. This is why the data structure
            is called a<strong> Segment Tree</strong>, even though in most
            implementations the tree is not constructed explicitly.
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            Below is a visual representation of a Segment Tree built over the
            array:
            <code className="st-inline-code"> a = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7]</code>
          </p>

          {/* Height explanation */}
          <p className="st-text st-highlight">
            The height of a Segment Tree is <code className="st-inline-code">O(log n)</code>, because
            when moving from the root to the leaves, the size of the segment is
            reduced by approximately half at each level.
          </p>

          <h1 className="st-title">Construction of the Segment Tree</h1>

          <p className="st-text">
            Before constructing a Segment Tree, we need to decide two important
            things:
          </p>

          <ul className="st-list">
            <li>
              <strong>The value stored at each node</strong> — for example, in a
              sum Segment Tree, each node stores the sum of elements in its range
              <code className="st-inline-code">[l, r]</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The merge operation</strong> — this defines how the values
              of two child nodes are combined. In a sum Segment Tree, the values
              are merged by adding them.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="st-text">
            A node is called a <strong>leaf node</strong> if its segment
            represents only a single element of the array. In that case, the value
            stored in the node is simply the corresponding array element.
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            To build the Segment Tree, we start from the leaf nodes and assign
            their values. Using the merge operation, we then compute the values of
            their parent nodes. This process continues until we reach the root
            node, which represents the entire array.
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            In practice, the construction is described recursively in the opposite
            direction, starting from the root node:
          </p>

          <ul className="st-list">
            <li>Recursively construct the left child node</li>
            <li>Recursively construct the right child node</li>
            <li>Merge the values of both children to compute the current node</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="st-text">
            By starting this process from the root node, we are able to construct
            the complete Segment Tree.
          </p>

          <p className="st-highlight">
            The time complexity of building a Segment Tree is
            <code className="st-inline-code"> O(n)</code>, assuming the merge operation takes constant
            time, since each node is processed exactly once.
          </p>

          <h1 className="st-title">Sum Queries and Update Queries</h1>

          <h2 className="st-heading">Sum Queries</h2>

          <p className="st-text">
            To compute the sum of a range{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">[l, r]</code>, we traverse the
            Segment Tree and use the precomputed sums stored in the nodes.
          </p>

          <ul className="st-list">
            <li>
              If the current node exactly matches the query range, return its
              stored sum.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the query lies fully in one child, recursively move to that
              child.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the query overlaps both children, split it, compute both parts,
              and add the results.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="st-highlight">
            Since only a limited number of nodes are visited at each level and the
            height of the tree is <code className="st-inline-code">O(log n)</code>, the total time
            complexity is <code className="st-inline-code">O(log n)</code>.
          </p>

          <h2 className="st-heading">Update Queries</h2>

          <p className="st-text">
            An update query modifies a single element in the array. We recursively
            traverse the tree to the leaf node representing that index and update
            its value.
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            While returning back up the tree, we recompute the values of all
            affected parent nodes using the merge operation.
          </p>

          <p className="st-highlight">
            Since only one node per level is updated, the time complexity of an
            update query is also <code className="st-inline-code">O(log n)</code>.
          </p>

          <h1 className="st-title">Implementation</h1>

          <p className="st-text">
            There are may ways to implement a Segment Tree. One common approach is
            to use an array-based representation, where the tree is stored in a
            flat array. This method is efficient in terms of both time and space.

          <p className="st-text">
            In an array-based representation, the Segment Tree is stored in an

          <p className="st-text">
            The <code className="st-inline-code">build</code> function constructs
            the segment tree using a recursive <strong>divide-and-conquer</strong>{" "}
            strategy. It takes the current segment tree index{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">idx</code>, the array range{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">[l, r]</code>, and the input
            array <code className="st-inline-code">arr</code>.
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            When <code className="st-inline-code">l == r</code>, the
            recursion reaches a <strong>leaf node</strong>, representing a single
            element of the array. At this point, the value{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">arr[l]</code> is directly stored in{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">seg[idx]</code>.
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            Otherwise, the current range is split at{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">mid</code> into two subranges:
            <code className="st-inline-code">[l, mid]</code> and{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">[mid + 1, r]</code>. The function
            then recursively builds the left child at{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">2 * idx + 1</code> and the right
            child at <code className="st-inline-code">2 * idx + 2</code>.

          <div className="st-highlight">
            <p className="st-text">
              After both children are constructed, the current node aggregates
              their values. In this implementation, the aggregation operation is
              <strong> sum</strong>:
              <code className="st-inline-code">
                seg[idx] = seg[2 * idx + 1] + seg[2 * idx + 2]

          <p className="st-text">
            The <code className="st-inline-code">rangeSumQuery</code> function is
            used to compute the sum of elements within a given query range{" "}

          <p className="st-text">
            To answer a query efficiently, the algorithm evaluates three possible
            overlap cases between the current segment and the query range.

          <ul className="st-list">
            <li>

              <code className="st-inline-code">[ql, qr]</code>, the function returns{" "}
              <code className="st-inline-code">0</code>, since it contributes
              nothing to the sum.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Complete Overlap:</strong> If the segment{" "}
              <code className="st-inline-code">[l, r]</code> is fully
              contained within the query range{" "}
              <code className="st-inline-code">[ql, qr]</code>, the precomputed
              value <code className="st-inline-code">seg[idx]</code> is returned
              directly. This avoids unnecessary recursion.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Partial Overlap:</strong> If the segment is partially inside
              and partially outside the query range, the segment is divided at{" "}
              <code className="st-inline-code">mid</code> into two halves:
              <code className="st-inline-code">[l, mid]</code> and{" "}
              <code className="st-inline-code">[mid + 1, r]</code>. The query
              is executed recursively on both children, and the final result is
              the sum of the left and right subqueries.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <div className="st-highlight">
            <p className="st-text">
              This operation is <strong>read-only</strong>. The segment tree is
              not modified during a range sum query, as no updates are required.
              The result is obtained purely through traversal and aggregation.
            </p>

          <h2 className="st-heading">Point Update Function</h2>
          <HighlightedCode code={AllCodes.pointUpdateCode} language="cpp" />

          <p className="st-text">
            The <code className="st-inline-code">pointUpdate</code> operation
            updates the value at a specific array index and reflects this change
            in the segment tree. It takes five parameters: the target{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">index</code>, the new value{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">val</code>, the segment tree index{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">idx</code>, and the segment range{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">[l, r]</code>.
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            The update process follows a binary-search–like traversal. At each
            recursive step, the current segment{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">[l, r]</code> is divided at{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">mid</code> to determine whether the
            target index lies in the left subtree{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">[l, mid]</code> or the right
            subtree <code className="st-inline-code">[mid + 1, r]</code>.
          </p>

          <p className="st-text">
            This process continues recursively until{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">l === r</code>, which represents a{" "}
            <strong>leaf node</strong>. This node corresponds exactly to the update index,
            and its value is increased by{" "}
            <code className="st-inline-code">val</code>.
          </p>

          <div className="st-highlight">
            <p className="st-text">
              While returning from recursion, each ancestor node is recomputed to
              maintain correctness of the tree. For a sum segment tree, the parent
              value is updated as:
              <br />
              <code className="st-inline-code">
                seg[idx] = seg[2 * idx + 1] + seg[2 * idx + 2]
              </code>
              <br />
              This ensures that all affected ranges reflect the updated index.
